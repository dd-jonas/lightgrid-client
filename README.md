# 23:41 - Light Grid

This project contains both the client to communicate with the server and a REST API to change the animation paths.

## Installation

1. `npm i`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the variables
3. Place lights in the room at the positions described in `src/config/index.js`. You can verify the correct ids by querying each light one by one using the `.rest` file along with the REST Client plugin for VS Code. Make sure to update the @baseUrl as needed first.
4. `npm run start`
