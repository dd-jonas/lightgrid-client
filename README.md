# 23:41 - Light Grid

This project contains both the client to communicate with the server and a REST API to change the animation paths.

## Installation

1. `npm i`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the variables
3. Place lights in the room at the positions described in `src/config/index.js`. You can verify the correct ids by querying each light one by one using the `.rest` file along with the REST Client plugin for VS Code. Make sure to update the @baseUrl as needed first.
4. `npm run start`

|  ID | Light         |
| --: | :------------ |
| 201 | Mary's Chest  |
| 202 | Desk          |
| 203 | Wall South    |
| 204 | Wall East     |
| 205 | Bookcase      |

| 210 | Ceiling       |

[^1]: At the end of every animation, the state will automatically transition and this new state id will be sent to the server.
[^2]: Not really a search since all of John's attributes are found at this point. Players should simply place the attributes on the table and take a seat to start the next seance.
